### Installing dependencies

A project's dependencies can be installed by running the following command in the project folder.

```
mbed deploy
```

This will produce warnings about not using source control management. These can be safely ignored.

### Compiling

A project can be compiled using

```
mbed compile
```

or if you wish to flash the board after compiling

```
mbed compile -f
```

### Connecting to serial terminal

All of our boards use a rate of 115200 baud.

```
mbed sterm -b 115200
```

### Adding libraries

Libraries can be added to a project using

```
mbed add <url>
```

then the corresponding directory should be added to the `.gitignore` in the project's directory.

### All other issues

For any other issues see the [mbed documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os).
